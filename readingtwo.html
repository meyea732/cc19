				The main advantage of developing communication methods with limited audiences is the ability to bond groups of people. Every individual has their own experience of the world. When a group of people shares a common identity they often experience the world in a similar way and through that they create specific language to describe it. I think this can bring people together but also alienate people. Additionally, the people an individual surrounds themselves with influences how they use language. It's a cycle that is hard to break. The use, or more often misuse, is picked up among groups of people and then taken further and further. It’s harder to break into new groups or change your language. In this sense language is kind of like a giant game of telephone. It is not a static thing. Humans began speaking, using pictures, then slowly transitioned to words. But ever since then it has kept changing. Like Delancy said, language as we know it has not been around that long. We could easily lose it, or rather it could quickly adapt to be something we can’t even recognize. I think that humans have a very micro understanding of our own history. We tend to blow our lifetimes out of proportion in terms of the bigger picture.

				However, Butler brings up a good point when she compares it to the climate change argument. She responds to people that don’t think the loss of language would be important with “Well, you're absolutely right, of course, but there weren't nearly so many of us, and we hadn't organized our society around certain things being so, that we grow this crop in this area and that we feed this many million people with it.” I think this is an important consideration when talking about the loss or adaptation of our language. Technology has brought on such an extreme change so quickly: to all aspects of life really. Changes happen so much faster than anytime before now. And those changes are much bigger. It almost justifies the human tendency to blow our lifetimes out of proportion just because so much is happening in such a short time. Butler made this comment in 1998 and I can’t imagine that she could have ever foreseen how much we would continue to change. With the violent video games, the creation of social media, and misinformation even more present than ever before, I couldn’t believe how relevant what they were talking about was to right now. When Butler spoke about the anonymity of the web, more specifically predicted how it would soon disappear, I couldn’t help thinking about instagram and snapchat. And she was completely right. You can no longer choose to be whoever you want. Your identity follows you online now.

				Young people are picking up language (and its changes) much faster than adults. But they are often picking up misused communication methods/ slang/ shortcuts. Adults are not picking these things up. I think both groups are stuck in their ways and don’t value the other groups literacy. I think this leads older generations to have a much more closed minded approach and understanding to the web. But young people are losing the ability to follow rules. Everything in language has become flexible. Literacy has become a very different thing. Already things like cursive aren’t even taught anymore. It’s only so long before we lose it. I saw the transition in my own elementary school. We went from having cursive classes, to having them replaced by computer class where we learned how to type. Literacy it literally changing right in front of our eyes. Technological literacy is much more valuable. It makes me curious if later coding will replace foreign language or something similar.

				I think that its true that hypertext has less freedom than “primitive hypertext.” I think the difference is that with hypertext you have to pre outline the options for the user. In real like the options are endless. The human mind can make connections between anything. And sometimes those connections don’t even make sense. Like Butler said, sometimes there isn’t a connection. Like with reading two unrelated books at the same time. The ideas bounce off each other anyway. So I think in that sense hypertext/ the web will always be limited. It's definitely exploded since Butler made this comment but I think it still holds true.

				Like I said before, so many of the points brought up in this conversation have been brought to realization. Violent video games now have almost no text in them. Snapchat and instagram require you to share your identity online. The ever growing presence and danger of misinformation is so much more relevant today. It's almost like they predicted all of these things. I think that almost everything they talked about is still relevant today.

				I’m always using primitive hypertext in my life. I think when I do homework assignments with a group of people around me I’m being influences and bouncing ideas off of what they say, even if we’re not talking about the homework. As a product design student I’m always using outside inspiration for the materials, form, and function of my products. Just recently I was designing the form of a shoe sole (the bottom of a shoe). I was looking at a map of new york city and started designing the treds to look like the streets of manhattan. This inspired me to look at other forms of maps: satellite, topographical, etc. And pretty soon I was creating a completely new sole. Being interrupted while reading a book and going back to it after some time has passed is primitive hypertext. Even while writing this essay I was listening to music which probably changed how I thought about the prompts: whether it was a happy beat, a slow one, the word choice, my focus. Primitive hypertext is all around us and it is endless. This is why I think hypertext in terms of the web is limiting.
