				Reading response: 
				What perspectives or feelings do you have on your entrance into web design as a practice? Any specific hopes, fears, or curiosities?
				As I enter into the realm of web design I am apprehensive. As a product design student interested in UI/UX design its something that I'm interested in, but don't know much about. I hope to expand my knowledge and be able to combine it with my product design and data visualization focuses. I think this will be beneficial for me. I am slightly fearful of the self taught aspect of the course because I know it requires a lot of outside work and research. I'm nervous that at the beginning I won't know the right terminology to even look it up. I hope that we will work on larger projects in this class or at least skills that will be applicable to large scale projects. I am a designer more than an artist so a large focus of mine is functionality and usefulness. I am hopeful/ curious to see if this class will prepare me for a junior level class called Topics: "web/mobile product design in the spring"
				<br>
				Which issues that Sam discussed are new to you?
				All the abbreviations. The language of code/ building websites from scratch is completely new to me. I hope this class will make me a little more familiar. 
				</br>
				<br>
				Which do you feel passionate about learning more of?
				I'm really passionate about how to make my designs more accessible. Both for disability and just functionality. Additionally I want to learn how to get creative with my designs while not losing any of that functionality I was talking about.
