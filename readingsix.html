				Adding to the article, why do you see value in nonlinear narratives? When do you think they are more appropriate than linear narratives?
				<br/>
				I think that nonlinear narratives can add a different perspective to the story and influence how you may respond to information later on. As humans we are influenced by our backgrounds and the context through which we view the world. On a micro level this can be seen through nonlinear stories. Depending on the order in which we view the each part of the story, we respond differently. I think this can be especially useful when the story has multiple primary characters. Additionally, it can be useful when there is a lot of background context and information that is happening at the same time.
				<br/>
				How does the history of hypertext/hypermedia discussed at the beginning of this semester connect to the concepts and projects discussed in this article?
				<br/>
				Similarly to hyperlinks, nonlinear stories branch out. They allow for different possibilities and experiences depending on the viewers choices. The story line does not flow in the traditional sense. It is choppy and broken up by alternate storylines or different contexts.

				I saw this webbsite recently and thought it reminded me of a nonlinear story. The way that it includes hypertext and allows you to jump around the backstory is what made me think it qualified. Hereâ€™s the link:
