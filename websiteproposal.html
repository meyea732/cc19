				In this week of brainstorming, I was talking to one of my close friends who is majoring in Creative Writing and Photography. She just completed a year long project which documents every one of her possessions in an ongoing still life. When compiled this book stretches multiple NYC blocks all together. As we were talking we imagined a digital and interactive way of immersing yourself in this piece of art. I thought that this would be a perfect project to take on in this class. For my website I want to use my friends photography and writing to put together a website that allows her work to more accessible as well as dynamic. I envision the home page to have a photograph of her, the artist, surrounded by all of her objects upon loading. Using the z index I want “The Perch” to be splayed across the page with some of the objects in front, slightly covering the edges and to add a three dimensional element. Additionally, I would like to add a subtle element of movement to some of these objects. Not overwhelming but just enough that the viewer takes a second glance and a bit longer to process the photograph on the screen. My friend and I often talk about how hard it is in a gallery setting to capture the viewer's attention for longer than a couple seconds. I think there is a similar challenge on the internet, if not more so. But with that, there are more dynamic methods that can be used to solve that challenge: turning the viewer into a user. I am excited to bring those into her work. Below the title I want to add a quick artist statement before beginning the book. As the user scrolls down the page, I’d like to add a bar to the left side which shows where you are in the book. I think it would be interesting to show this in relation to pages as well as something like NYC blocks to express the scale that may be lost digitally. My inspiration for this bar comes from the interactive reading assignment in which we looked at this website (https://arroyo.jon-kyle.com/). I would like the user to be able to jump around and track their progress. As the user hovers over certain objects I would like to add narratives about their meaning, additional context, and supplemental information that isn’t present in the original book. This idea is similar to the 50 State Blueprint website visualization. With each dot representing a different individual in the prison system. More information is revealed the further you scroll down. Because this website will be so content heavy it will probably load relatively slowly. I plan to use javascript to make the loading feel like it is going faster with animations, page transitions, and preloaders. This project will be a good challenge for myself as well as something both my friend and I can add to our portfolios as designers and artists.
