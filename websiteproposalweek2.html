				In this week of brainstorming, I was talking to one of my close friends who is majoring in Creative Writing and Photography. She just completed a year long project which documents every one of her possessions in an ongoing still life. She stitched together the still life so that there were no breaks. The objects overflow from one page to another. When compiled this book stretches multiple NYC blocks all together. As we were talking we imagined a digital and interactive way of immersing yourself in this piece of art. The audience I thought that this would be a perfect project to take on in this class.
				<br/>
				For my website I want to use my friends photography and writing to put together a website that allows her work to more accessible as well as dynamic. Currently all of her work is displayed as prints and/or  books. While there are unique and tactile qualities about this approach, it is also restrictive. Recently she has not been able to keep up with the demand to get her work into the world. Her books tend to come in series of 10-15. This problem was the inspiration behind the project. At the end of the semester she is having her first show in the city, featuring this project. There will only be 12 books available for sale, so the audience of the website will be for the people who are unable to purchase one of the 12. The target audience will be people new to her work and will serve as an introduction.

				I envision the home page to have a photograph of her, the artist, surrounded by all of her objects upon loading. I already have this photograph digitally. Using the z index I want “The Perch” to be splayed across the page with some of the objects in front, slightly covering the edges and to add a three dimensional element, similar to the test in the assignment from week 5: “The Tree That Grows Everything.”  Additionally, I would like to add a subtle element of movement to some of these objects. Not overwhelming but just enough that the viewer takes a second glance and a bit longer to process the photograph on the screen. My friend and I often talk about how hard it is in a gallery setting to capture the viewer's attention for longer than a couple seconds. I think there is a similar challenge on the internet, if not more so. But with that, there are more dynamic methods that can be used to solve that challenge: turning the viewer into a user. I am excited to bring these techniques into her work. Below the title I want to add a quick artist statement before beginning the book. I still have to get her artist statement which I plan on doing in an interview with her in the next week.

				As the user scrolls down the page, I’d like to add a bar to the left side which shows where you are in the book. I already have high quality digital photographs of the book to use. I think it would be interesting to show this in relation to pages as well as something like NYC blocks to express the scale that may be lost digitally. The whole project is meant to make the viewer feel overwhelmed by the scale of the project so I want to emphasize that when using a digital medium. My inspiration for this bar comes from the interactive reading assignment in which we looked at this website (https://arroyo.jon-kyle.com/). I would like the user to be able to jump around and track their progress. As the user hovers over certain objects I would like to add narratives about their meaning, additional context, and supplemental information that isn’t present in the original book. I also plan on getting this in an interview with her in the next week. This idea is similar to the 50 State Blueprint website visualization. With each dot representing a different individual in the prison system. More information is revealed the further you scroll down. Because this website will be so content heavy it will probably load relatively slowly. I plan to use javascript to make the loading feel like it is going faster with animations, page transitions, and preloaders. Although overwhelming, I still want this website to be intuitive, user friendly, and welcoming so that users are intrigued and want to learn more about the artist. This project will be a good challenge for myself as well as something both my friend and I can add to our portfolios as designers and artists.
