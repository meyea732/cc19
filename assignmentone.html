				I found this website very intriguing as a student with a data/ information visualization minor. I think the simplicity of the visualization is powerful. It is easily read and understand at a first glance. This is important in our society that is driven by instant gratification. The simplicity is effective and once the viewer is hooked they can interact with the visualization to uncover more depth. This peaked my curiosity. Originally I thought it may be too simple; I am cynical of any information visualization due to how often information is misconstrued to further an individual/ corporation’s policy or agenda. I was pleasantly surprised that after the original screen peaked my curiosity I could where the information came from, what policy it was supporting, and the exact changes (including numbers) being implemented. Overall I appreciated the ease of use and comprehensibility. I was already informed of Prison Reform ideas before viewing this website, but I left confidently in support of this organization due to the ease of use, professional aesthetic, and content.

				This website was intriguing to me because I had never encountered anything similar. It incorporated so many different types of media, writing, video, and photographs, in such a nontraditional way. I took a while to explore it and loved the unique style of sharing the story of this village. I liked the way of piecing together photographs to make a virtual world. One aspect of the website I didn’t like as much was the amount of time it took to load in between each scene. After a while it was frustrating to wait multiple seconds for the rectangle and text to appear. This just speaks to the societal impatience I discussed in the previous paragraph that even I cannot escape. This is a very small critique because overall the website was very successful. The collage was so interesting and made me want to explore every scene. I want to know if there are more websites done in a similar fashion.

				Again I picked this website because of my background and interest in data visualization. I like the interactive aspect of it. Similar to the 20 State Blueprint website, it is effective because of its simplicity. I appreciate that the raw data and resources are there when you look for them, but are veiled originally to the viewer so they are not overwhelmed. The more I interacted with it the more data I found I actually had access to. For instance after a couple minutes of fiddling with it I found out I could click on a country and read information specifically pertaining to that topic and country; I could even see events that occurred in a specific year and what rank in the world that country held in relation to the given topic. I have been very drawn to interactive visualizations so I hope this class introduces me to a way of accomplishing something similar.
