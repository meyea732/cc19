				Reading response: 
				The beginning of the reading caught my interest immediately. Not because it gave me the “warm firey feeling” like Frank Chimero described but because it reminded me of the composer John Cage that I head recently heard of in another one of my classes. The sound was chaotic and unfamiliar to me because I do not have the same type of nostalgia tied to it. The reading was abrupt and choppy, but it got me thinking deeply about its content. I found myself getting reminded by or inspired by the points Chimero was bringing up which made me skip around to other things then come back with other knowledge; kind of like that website we visited in class during the lecture on hyperlinks. Not until later in the reading did I realize that this structure was also tied to the content of the reading. I related to his point about web design with scaling considerations in mind in my own work because I’ve recently made a website to showcase my portfolio. I spent a while on it and I was excited about the layout until one of my friends pulled it out on their phone and the layout was completely different. In the article Frank Chimero made some valid points about how designers aren’t effectively using the internet as an effective medium. When the constraints are taken into account, our current way of displaying content isn’t a good method of digital communication at all. Its just “the way its always been done.” And humans are incredibly stubborn. I think that expanding our horizons onto more creative and untapped methods would take advantage of the concept of agelessness. It would turn the previous weaknesses of scaling and turn them into strengths.
